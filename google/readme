Evaluate modified RPN
---------------------
Expression can be a single integer or surrounded by ( and ).   
Operands can be + or *.

Example:

+ ( * 1 ( + 1 2 3 ) ) => 6
+ ( * ( + 1 1 ) 17 ) => 34
+ 7 => 7
+ ( * 17 ( + 1 1 ) ) => 34

[Party at Hali-Bula](http://poj.org/problem?id=3342)
----------------------------------------------------
Suppose we are planning a company party. The company organizational structure is so that there is a single Owner who runs the place. Everyone has one direct manager, but a manager may have any number of direct reports.  Everyone must report to the big boss, possibly indirectly.  
Each employee has associated with him/her a non-negative “fun” value.  What we want to do is invite the set of employees to make the party __as fun as possible__.  

Here is the only constraint:  If you invite an employee, you cannot invite that employee’s direct manager.  
```
            A
     B              C
  I    J        D       E
         F     G H
```
If we include A:  total fun value should Fun(A)=sum_{i=I,J,D,E}(Fun(i))  
no A:      Fun(A)={Fun(B)+Fun(C)}  
It’s legal to invite B and C  
Or it’s legal to invite D, E, A, but you cannot invite D and C, or B and A.  

Boxes
-----
有若干个盒子，每个盒子有length和width，不考虑高度。只要尺寸fit，大盒子就可以放小盒子，但是一层只能套一个，即便还有空余；但可以多层嵌套。  
求最小的面积放所有的盒子  
比如 ``7*7`` , ``5*5``, ``4*6``, ``3*3``, 答案是 ``7*7 + 4*6``.

Consecutive linked list?
------------------------
Given a single list A->B->C->E….->Z  with  with node type:
```
Node {
  T value;
  Node* next;
}
```
Find how many clusters in the array. The cluster means all the Node in the cluster is consecutive in the list.
for instance
```
result:   D E F J G H C
cluster 1 c d e f g h
cluster 2 j
```

Max area
--------
n x n parcels in city; matrix M contains the cost of each parcel; budget B
find largest rectangular area in the city you can afford.

Social network?
---------------
在social network中，如何推荐陌生人中和自己共同好友最多的人。

Queue array?
------------
a) you have a Queue array, Queue<Integer>[] queues，get the shortest length queue,返回的是queue的index。pop is expensive.这个queue是动态更新的，肯定不能直接size();  

b) find the queue with min sum queue, all with non-negative numbers.
